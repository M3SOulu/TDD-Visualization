Introduction for the project:

1. NPM
  1.1 Test: Run node -v. The version should be higher than v0.10.32.
  1.2 Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. 
      However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, 
      so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.npm 
      install npm -g
  1.3 after that t should be fine.
